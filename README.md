VBA challenge: The VBA of Wall Street

In this homework assignment, I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.

This scriptscript loops through all the stocks from 2014 - 2016 and output the following information.
 * The ticker symbol.
 * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
 * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
 * The total stock volume of the stock.
 * Furthermore, it includes conditional formatting that highlights positive changes in green and negative changes in red.
